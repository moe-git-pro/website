         "content":"The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. However, this transformation also brings new security challenges that organizations must address. According to a recent survey by Cycode, 72% of security leaders agree that the age of AI necessitates a complete reset of how organizations approach application security. This urgency is reinforced by the staggering fact that 93 billion lines of code were generated in the past year alone. The sheer volume of new code being written and deployed creates an enormous attack surface, making it increasingly difficult for security teams to keep up with potential vulnerabilities. The age of AI has brought about a new level of complexity and risk to application security. Traditional security approaches, which rely on manual testing and patching, are no longer sufficient to keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of new applications. So, why do security leaders believe that a complete reset of application security is necessary? Here are a few reasons: Increased Complexity: AI-powered applications are more complex and interconnected than ever before, making it harder to identify and mitigate potential security risks. Rapid Development: The speed of development and deployment of new applications has increased exponentially, leaving security teams struggling to keep up with potential vulnerabilities. New Attack Vectors: AI-powered applications introduce new attack vectors, such as machine learning models and natural language processing, that traditional security approaches may not be equipped to handle. A complete reset of application security requires a fundamental shift in how organizations approach security. Here are a few key elements of a reset: Automated Testing: Automated testing and scanning can help identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in applications, reducing the risk of human error. DevSecOps: Integrating security into the development process, rather than treating it as an afterthought, can help ensure that security is built into applications from the start. AI-Powered Security Tools: Leveraging AI-powered security tools can help organizations keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of new applications, and identify potential security risks more effectively. The age of AI has brought about a new level of complexity and risk to application security. A complete reset of how organizations approach application security is necessary to keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of new applications. By adopting automated testing, DevSecOps, and AI-powered security tools, organizations can help ensure that their applications are secure and resilient in the face of evolving security threats.",
